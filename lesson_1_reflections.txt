Viewing a difference between two files showed what changed between the two. 
This helped us catch any typos or errors. 
In particular, it helped if you accidentally changed something beyond what you meant to change. 
It also helped bring you to the lines that changed, even if you meant to change them. 

Having easy access to a file's history can help you learn from it.  
You can see where you went wrong, and make sure you don't repeat that mistake. 
You can also come back after you've learned a new tool and see how it might have helped.  

Manual commits are good because they can come at logical points and when the code would run. 
Automatic commits are nice because you won't forget. 

Git and others allow multiple file commits because they are designed for projects where files tend to be interrelated. 
Other systems, like google docs, are not designed for this type of project. 

You can use git log to see all of the commits. 
You can use git diff to see the difference between any two of these commits. 

If it is easy to go back to an earlier version, then taking risks is less scary.
You can't really mess it up permanently if you can always 'undo'!

I want to use git to keep track of files for my dissertation.
